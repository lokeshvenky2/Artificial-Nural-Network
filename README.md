- Easy to follow for beginners and intermediate machine learning practitioners.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- pandas

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook artificial_neural_network.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run each cell and observe the results.

## Results
